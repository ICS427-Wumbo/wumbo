# Assignment 2 Wumbo README
ICS 427 project

## What is done

	For this assignment, we have finalized the basic frameworks and tools we will be using and have set up the foundations of our code for this project .  Our project is a React based web application which we manage using GitHub, work with in Intellij, and analyze using ESLint.  For the base of our project, we used the Meteor template introduced to us in ICS 314, and have modified it slightly to suit our project.  Our project contains a simple login system with admin and user differentiation, and a basic data input form.
  
  ## What is pending
  
  	Since the basic functionality of the site is in place, we now need to work on the UI to display data and the permissions the roles allow.  Since we are creating a social media application, we need to reorganize the data into profile formats which only its owner user should have permissions to edit.  Administrators will be given permission to remove users and profiles.  We also plan to add the ability for users to rate and comment on other users profiles.  Currently, information is being stored in the settings.development.json file, which will have to change if we need to host our application in the future.
